Lab 5

Part 1:

Using the specification described in the lab description I combined tcp-recver.c and mdb-lookup.c to create the online lookup server. I also copied mylist.h and mdb.c to the file so that I could use the lab4 solution code for the linked list. 

Part 2:

Using the parameters set up in the lab, I created a not as good version of wgets by requesting a website using an http GET command. Then, the program will create a new file named the same as the file on the website and transfer all the data from the website to the file. Edge cases are taken care of with the die commands.
